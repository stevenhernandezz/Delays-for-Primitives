# Delays-for-Primitives
 This project focuses on working with delays for primitves by testing combinations, and using simulation.
 
## Description 
 This project includes a circuit that has 2 inputs which are in1, and in2, as well as 2 AND gates, an inverter, and a NAND gate with 1 output. Once the first circuit was constructed, I updated the circuit by adding an OR gate. By updating the circuit I was able to decrease the critical path (longest delay).
